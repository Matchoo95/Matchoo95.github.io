This seems like a really cool idea so far and I have no idea why I haven't tried playing with it before. 
I can use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to manage content and markdown really easily and efficiently. 
So far it seems pretty easy :) 
I look forward to implementing this in other repos from now on!
